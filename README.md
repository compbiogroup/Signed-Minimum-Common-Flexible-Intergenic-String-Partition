# Signed Minimum Common Flexible Intergenic String Partition

Algorithms for the Signed Minimum Common Flexible Intergenic String Partition (SMCFISP) problem described in the paper "Partition Based Algorithms for Rearrangement Distances with Flexible Intergenic Region Information".

## Instances

Some generated instances are available in the dataset folder. In the file names, L and O are the parameters defining the size of the alphabet used to generate the source genome and the number of operations used to generate the target genome, respectively. Sets with names starting with R were generated with operations of reversal and sets with names starting with RT were generated with operations of reversal and transposition.
